A dusty bedroom with a single, unmade bed.
A grand ballroom, eerily silent except for the creaking floorboards.
A cold, sterile operating room.
A child's playroom, with a lone rocking horse swaying gently.
A long, dark hallway with flickering lights.
A library with books scattered all over the floor.
A kitchen, with the faint smell of decay.
A damp, musty basement.
A rooftop, with a chilling view of the desolate city below.
A claustrophobic elevator, stuck between floors.

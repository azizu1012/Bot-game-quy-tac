The metallic tang of blood.
The cloying sweetness of rot.
The sharp, clean scent of antiseptic.
The musty odor of old paper and dust.
The smell of ozone, as if from an electrical discharge.
The faint scent of perfume, long since faded.
The smell of damp earth and decay.
The odor of stale, stagnant water.
The smell of rust and old machinery.
A strange, unidentifiable chemical smell.

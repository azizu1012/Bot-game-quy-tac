A weeping bride, forever searching for her groom.
A shadowy figure that flits at the edge of your vision.
The ghost of a small child, giggling in the darkness.
A vengeful spirit, its face contorted in a silent scream.
A poltergeist that throws objects around the room.
A transparent apparition that drifts through walls.
A chain-rattling specter, bound to its place of death.
A phantom nurse, still making her rounds.
A ghostly dog, howling mournfully.
The tormented soul of a failed experiment.
